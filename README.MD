### Setup
- Run` pod install` on terminal. (If your cocoapods repository is not up to date please run `pod repo update` first.)
- The open Recipe.xcworkspace and run.


### Project Architecture

The app architecture is MVVM + Repository Pattern. Let's see in a simple usage,
    
    ViewController 
        -> ViewModel
            -> Repository 
                -> DataSource (RemoteDataSource || LocalDataSource)
                    -> Service (RemoteService || XLocalService)
                        -> BaseService || LocalService
                        
- **ViewModel**: Receives information from ViewController and handles it. Interacts with repositories.
- **Repository**: Gets  data from RemoteDataSource or LocalDataSource and converts it to UIModel then sends it to the ViewModel.
- **LocalDataSource**: Gets data from local service and sends it to the repository.
- **RemoteDataSource**: Gets data from remote service and sends it to the repository. It can include more then one service and things like merging two reqeusts can be done here.
- **XLocalService**: Gets data from base LocalService and sends it back.
- **RemoteService**: Gets data from remote and sends it back.

### Unit Test

You can find unit tests under RecipeTests. Current test coverage is %65.


### Features

Basic functionalities are explained here. Recipe app also supports dark mode.

| Feature             | Description                                          | ViewController |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|**Listing All Collections**| Lists all collections as grid or list| CollectionsViewController|
|**Listing All Recipes**| Lists all recipies. User can add a recipe to favorites or remove it from favorites.|RecipesViewController|
|**Listing Favorited Recipies**| Lists all favorited recipies. User can remove a recipe from favorited list.| FavoritesViewController|


### Things to Do 

- Remove Resolver library and write a custom dependency injection with propertyWrappers.
- RecipeDetail screen.
- Protocol oriented router development for navigating between screens.
- Adding some UITests.
- Error management and progress indicator.
